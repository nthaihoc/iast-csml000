[https://openreview.net/group?id=kaist.ac.kr/KAIST/Fall2023/CS479](https://openreview.net/group?id=kaist.ac.kr/KAIST/Fall2023/CS479){:target="_blank"}


### Review Process

- You will be asked to review *two* projects, and each project will be reviewed by at least *four* peer reviewers and also *two* TAs.
- The review process will be *single-blind* and will be performed in **OpenReview**. You may receive a penalty if you disclose which project you will review.
- ==Reviews can be **rejected** based on the assessment of the review quality, and rejected reviews will be penalized in the paper/project review scores &mdash; see [Penalty](#penalty).==
- ==You can participate in the reviews after you receive the perfect score from the **paper review quiz**.== Any reviews submitted before attaining this perfect score will NOT be accepted and will be considered as not submitted. Refer to the [paper review](../paper-review){:target="_blank"} page for the details.


### Review Questions

==Total score range: [-8 ~ +8]==


#### Note
- 'Outstanding' is outstanding. Consider giving this score when you think this team seems the best in the class.  
- 'Poor' is poor. Consider giving this score when you think this team is REALLY bad.


#### Summary
Summarize the project ideas in ~5 sentences. Describe the goal of the project, the achievements, and strengths and weaknesses compared with the other projects.


#### Plagiarism
If you find any suspected plagiarism, please describe it here.


#### Writing
- **[+2] Outstanding.** Clearly described motivation, method or implementation details, and experimental results. Very well organized the paper, and very easy to follow the paper. Includes sufficient illustrations for the methods or implementation details, and figures and tables for the experimental results. (Almost) no flaw. 
- **[+1] Great.**  Well organized the paper, and clearly described most parts. But it is a bit difficult to follow, or there are a few minor flaws.
- **[ 0] Moderate.**  Some descriptions are not clear to understand. Some details in the method, implementation details, or experimental setup are missing. Technically adequate, but some technical details are incorrect.
- **[-1] Needs to be improved.**  Some required sections or important details are missing. Too many flaws and mistakes in the writing. Fatal mistakes in the technical details.
- **[-2] Poor.**  Did not complete the writing. Most parts are missing.

Justify your rating. Be specific.


#### [Novel Problem Solving Track] Novelty

==Check out which parts the authors implemented and not implemented but borrowed the code from the other places. Only the parts the authors implemented need to be considered to evaluate the difficulty.==

- **[+2]** Very novel and interesting ideas that need to be published in an academic paper.
- **[+1]** Novel and interesting ideas.
- **[ 0]** Worthy contributions with some novel (but small) ideas. 
- **[-1]** Trivial ideas.
- **[-2]** Does not advance the state of knowledge , or closely duplicates existing work.

Justify your rating. Be specific.


#### [Performance Improvement Track] Implementation Difficulty

==Check out which parts the authors implemented and not implemented but borrowed the code from the other places. Only the parts the authors implemented need to be considered to evaluate the difficulty.==

- **[+2]** Very difficult. Requires extraordinary efforts and/or skills.
- **[+1]** More challenging than our project.
- **[ 0]** Challenging as much as our project.
- **[-1]** Easier than our project.
- **[-2]** Very easy.

#### [Novel Problem Solving Track] Experimental Results

==Refer to the guidelines about [Infeasible Experiments](#infeasible-experiments) before answering this question.==

- **[+4] Outstanding.** Showed clear outperformance than previous work in comprehensive experimental analyses. Showed very interesting results in a novel problem.  
- **[+3]** (Between +2 and +4)  
- **[+2] Great.**  Showed outperformance in some experiments. Showed promising results in a novel problem.  
- **[+1]** (Between 0 and +2)  
- **[ 0] Moderate.** No outperformance or interesting results for now, but perhaps they would get promising results if they spend more time.  
- **[-1]** (Between -2 and 0)  
- **[-2] Not good.** The results do not look promising. The performance is clearly worse than previous work, or there is no improvement in incremental work.  
- **[-3]** (Between -4 and 2)  
- **[-4] Poor.** Did not complete the implementation, or did not show any meaningful results.

#### [Performance Improvement Track] Experimental Results

==Refer to the guidelines about [Infeasible Experiments](#infeasible-experiments) before answering this question.==

- **[+4] Outstanding. **The results are comparable to or even better than those of the paper. Provided more experimental results than the paper. Improved the method and showed better performance.  
- **[+3]** (Between +2 and +4)  
- **[+2] Great. **Reproduced (almost) all experimental results in the paper except for some infeasible experiments. The results are comparable to or even slightly better than those of the paper.  
- **[+1]** (Between 0 and +2)  
- **[ 0] Moderate.** Reproduced most of the major experimental results. The results are comparable to those of the paper. Missed a few less important experiments.  
- **[-1]** (Between -2 and 0)  
- **[-2] Not good.** Missed many experimental results. The results are clearly worse. The comparison is not fair.  
- **[-3]** (Between -4 and 2)  
- **[-4] Poor.** Did not complete the implementation, or did not reproduce the results at all. Showed very bad results.

#### Feedback
Provide questions or comments. Please be constructive, respectful, and detailed in your comments.


### Rebuttal and Final Decision Process

- After the review deadline, the authors will have an opportunity to rebut the review comments in OpenReview.
- ==All the reviewers are responsible to read the rebuttal and check how the authors addressed the reviewers' comments.==
- Reviewers can adjust the review comments and scores after the rebuttal.
- The review scores will NOT be averaged. There will be a discussion among the reviewers on Slack, and the final score will be decided in the discussion.


### Penalty
- **Late submission**: A 10% penalty for **each** late day and for **each** review in the paper/project review scores.
- ==Note that the reviews can be **rejected** based on the assessment of the review quality. The rejected reviews will be considered as not submitted.==
