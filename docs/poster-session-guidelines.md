### Poster Guidelines

The poster sessions are crucial, showcasing your project outputs to classmates and the public. There will be **two** sessions, and you are required to present your poster on **one** of the days. The sessions will be **open** to the public, and attendance at **both** sessions is **mandatory**.



### Poster Session Preparation
- We will start the poster sessions at **10:00 am**. If you have a class at this time, please provide evidence that you’re attending a course during this period. You’ll then be allowed to join at 10:30 am.

- On the presentation date, you must arrive at the poster session **15 minutes earlier** and attach the poster yourself.

- Check out your presentation date below. You will serve as a presenter in one session and a questioner in the other.

- When you present, the projects you review will NOT be presented in the same session.

- In the session where you present, ensure that **at least one team member** is on **standby** in front of your poster throughout the entire session, ready to address questions.

- As a presenter, prepare a 1-2 minute pitch. Questioners may approach posters and ask you to ``introduce your project''.

- The instructor will stop by each poster with the schedule below (subject to change).

- ^^[IMPORTANT] The review will follow a blind system. Reviewers must not reveal which papers they review.^^

- ^^[IMPORTANT] All discussions during the poster sessions must be done in English^^.
