## Project Team Matching

^^Due^^: ==September 8 (Friday), 23:59 KST==  
^^What to submit^^: ==The project title, project keywords, and teammate names==  
^^Where to submit^^: ==OpenReview==  

###Maximum number of teammates
You are allowed to form a team with a **maximum of three people**. All teams will be assessed in the same way, regardless of how many people are in the team. It is hence recommended to have three people in the team. All members of a project team will receive the same grade for the project, unless under extraordinary circumstances.

###Course withdrawal
If you withdraw from the course after the team-building deadline, your team will lose one teammate. So, please consider this schedule if you decide to drop the course.

###OpenReview submission
Submit your project details on **OpenReview**, including the project title, project keywords, and teammate names. You can make changes to the title, keywords, and teammates until the project pitches. However, please be aware that the title and keywords submitted until this deadline should not be arbitrary random texts (TAs will decide on them). Disregard the other forms (e.g., proposal, pitch video, report, poster, etc.) at this time.

###Grading
- **Late submission**: A 5% penalty for each late day in the project evaluation.
- A submission with any missing items will be considered as not submitted.
