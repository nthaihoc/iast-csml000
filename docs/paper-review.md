## Paper Review

Your course project will undergo a **peer review** process. Your project submission will be evaluated by at least *four* fellow students, along with two TAs. In return, you are expected to review and evaluate *two* project submissions from your peers.

In your role as a reviewer, it is essential to familiarize yourself with the baseline work of the projects you are assigned to review before conducting your assessment.

As a project submitter, you are required to create a **Google Form quiz** containing **three** questions related to the method of the baseline work. This quiz is intended to confirm that the reviewers have indeed become acquainted with the baseline work and are prepared to evaluate your project submission.
