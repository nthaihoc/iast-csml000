## Description
This course provides knowledge on artificial intelligence, with a particular focus on machine learning. Learners will gain a solid understanding of core machine learning concepts, including key algorithms for supervised and unsupervised learning, as well as widely-used techniques in the field. The course also guides learners on how to comprehensively set up, implement, and evaluate models, helping them understand the full process of building a machine learning system from start to finish.


## What You'll learn 
- Grasp the core concepts and mechanics of foundational machine learning algorithms.
- Develop complete machine learning models using TensorFlow, scikit-learn, and Keras, covering algorithms for regression (like Linear and Lasso Regression) and classification (such as SVM, Naive Bayes, Decision Trees).
- Master techniques for fine-tuning, evaluating, and optimizing machine learning models to enhance their performance and accuracy.

## Prerequisites
- Have a strong foundation in linear algebra, probability, statistics, and basic calculus, enabling you to understand the mathematical concepts behind machine learning.
- Be comfortable with Python programming, with practical experience in writing and debugging code for machine learning tasks.
- Have hands-on experience working with popular machine learning libraries, including TensorFlow, Keras, and scikit-learn, to implement and experiment with various algorithms.
