## Project Interim Report

^^1st report due^^: ==November 5 (Sunday), 23:59 KST==  
^^2nd report due^^: ==November 19 (Sunday), 23:59 KST==  
^^What to submit^^: ==A write-up (up to two A4 pages; shorter is preferred). No template provided.==  
^^Where to submit^^: ==OpenReview==  

Every team is required to submit the interim progress report **twice**. Make the report concise; shorter reports are preferred.

For each team, submit a write-up including the following:

- Project title
- Project track
- Submission ID (assigned by OpenReview)
- All teammate names
- The link to the GitHub repository for your project.
- Project progress (Refer to the [project progress](#project-progress) tab below)
- Revised timeline
    - Write an updated timeline for the remaining time.

### Project Progress

Based on the previous timeline (1st interim - the timeline in the proposal, 2nd interim - the timeline in the 1st interim), **color-code** each item in the timeline as follows.

- <mark style="background-color: #00FF00">Completed</mark>  
- <mark style="background-color: #FFFF00">In progress (as scheduled)</mark>  
- <mark style="background-color: #C0C0C0">Delayed</mark> - Briefly explain why.
- <mark style="background-color: #FF5C5C">Have issues</mark> - Briefly explain the issues. 

For the cases marked as <mark style="background-color: #C0C0C0">Delayed</mark> or <mark style="background-color: #FF5C5C">Have issues</mark>, provide a brief explanation of the problems and propose solutions.

Keep it concise; avoid creating a lengthy write-up.

### Grading
- **Late submission**: A 5% penalty for each late day in the project evaluation.
- A submission with any missing items will be considered as not submitted.
